I am a research economist and PhD candidate at the University of New Mexico.  
My work sits at the intersection of environmental & resource economics, urban economics, and applied econometrics, with a current focus on wildfire smoke exposure, health externalities, and spatial analysis. `Professional-pic2.jpg`

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://github.com/jawhari1) and [Academicons](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedjawhari/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
